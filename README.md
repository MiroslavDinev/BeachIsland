# BeachIsland

**Beach Island** is a web application for Angular course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/ "SoftUni"). The server is built on ASP.NET CORE 6.0 and it is using SQL Server for storing the data. The front end relies on Angular 14. The application consists of roles (user, partner and administrator) and offers (islands). Each user can register, login and logout. Users can also search for the offer they are looking for, view each offer details and book it via contact form sending email to administrator. Partners can add offers (needs to be approved by administrator to become publically visible), edit and delete their own offers. Admins can edit, approve and delete offers.
